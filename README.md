# Introduction to Machine Learning with R and Caret
 <br />
 <b>Introduction</b> <br />
 <br />
The caret package developed by Max Kuhn is short for Classification and Regression Training. It contains a set of functions that streamline the process of creating predictive models. It contains a set of packages to perform the following functions: <br />
•	data splitting <br />
•	pre-processing <br />
•	feature selection <br />
•	model tuning using resampling <br />
•	variable importance estimation <br />
 <br />
In this example I have tried to learn the basis of caret by implementing a few features on the Titanic dataset. <br />
 <br />
<b>Data Pre-Processing with Caret</b> <br />
<br />
The below trasforms have been implemented on Iris and PimaIndiansDiabetes datasets: <br />
•	Scale <br />
•	Center <br />
•	Standardize <br />
•	Normalize <br />
•	Box Cox transform <br />
•	Yeo-Johnson transform <br />
•	Principle Component Analysis <br />
•	Independent Componenet Analysis <br />
<br />
