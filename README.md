# Introduction to Machine Learning with R and Caret
 <br />
 <b>Introduction to Caret with Titanic dataset</b> <br />
 <br />
The caret package developed by Max Kuhn is short for Classification and Regression Training. It contains a set of functions that streamline the process of creating predictive models. It contains a set of packages to perform the following functions: <br />
•	data splitting <br />
•	pre-processing <br />
•	feature selection <br />
•	model tuning using resampling <br />
•	variable importance estimation <br />
 <br />
In this example I have tried to learn the basis of caret by implementing a few features on the Titanic dataset. <br />
 <br />
<b>Data Pre-Processing with Caret</b> <br />
<br />
The below trasforms have been implemented on Iris and PimaIndiansDiabetes datasets: <br />
•	Data scaling <br />
•	Data centering <br />
•	Data standardization <br />
•	Data normalization <br />
•	The Box-Cox Transform <br />
•	The Yeo-Johnson Transform <br />
•	PCA (Principle Component Analysis) Transform <br />
•	ICA (Independent Componenet Analysis) Transform <br />
