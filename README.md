# Introduction to Machine Learning with R and Caret
</ br>
The caret package developed by Max Kuhn is short for Classification and Regression Training. It contains a set of functions that streamline the process of creating predictive models. It contains a set of packages to perform the following functions: < /br>
•	data splitting < /br>
•	pre-processing < /br>
•	feature selection < /br>
•	model tuning using resampling < /br>
•	variable importance estimation < /br>

In this example I have tried to learn the basis of caret by implementing a few features on the Titanic dataset.
