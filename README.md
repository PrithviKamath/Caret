# Introduction to Machine Learning with R and Caret

The caret package developed by Max Kuhn is short for Classification and Regression Training. It contains a set of functions that streamline the process of creating predictive models. It contains a set of packages to perform the following functions:
•	data splitting
•	pre-processing
•	feature selection
•	model tuning using resampling
•	variable importance estimation

In this example I have tried to learn the basis of caret by implementing a few features on the Titanic dataset.
